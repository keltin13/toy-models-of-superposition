# Toy Models of Superposition - Code Companion

This notebook replicates every result from Anthropic's [Toy Model of Superposition](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html) paper. The results are ordered the same as in TMS and follow the same notation, so can be compared directly, starting with the [Demonstrating Superposition](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html#demonstrating) section.
